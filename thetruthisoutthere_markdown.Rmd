## Introduction to R programming, final assignment: statistical analysis of the UFO sightings database
</center> 




Space, the final frontier. These are my attempts at statistical analysis of the UFO sightings database of the National UFO Reporting Center. After the exploration of the dataset I investigated the relationship between the duration of the reported UFO sightings and both the shape of the reported object and the lighting conditions of the sighting using non-parametric statistical tests. The results showed a significantly shorter sighting duration for "fireball" shaped objects, and a significant difference between the sighting durations during the night and by daylight.



### The dataset  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
setwd("D:/BME Kogtan/PHD/ELÕADÁSOK/2017 õsz - Introduction to R/assignment_final")
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)

data<- read_csv("scrubbed.csv")
```

I explored the "UFO sightings" dataset downloaded from kaggle, provided by the National UFO Reporting Center. I used the "scrubbed" version of the dataset, which does not include reports with missing locations and dates. It contains 80332 UFO sighting reports from the last century in a long-format dataset. The variables including information about the individual UFO sightings in the original dataset are datetime (day/month/year hour:minute), city, state, country, shape, duration (seconds), duration (hours/min), comments, date posted, latitude and longitude.


***


### Exploratory data analysis 

To explore the data, first I determined the number of missing values in both the whole dataset and by column. There were overall 17680 missing vales, 5797 in state, 9670 in country, 1932 in shape and 265 in duration (second). 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# number of missing values
sum(is.na(data))
# missing values by column 
colSums(is.na(data)) 
```


I tidied the data by removing the missing values, renaming the duration variables (into duration_s and duration_hm) and separating the datetime variable into year, month, day, hour and mins (minutes). I wanted to focus on the sightings from the USA in my analysis, so I filtered the data for that country.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_tidy <- 
  data %>% 
  separate (col = datetime, into = c("month", "day","year"), 
            sep= "/") %>% 
  separate (col = year, into = c("year", "hour"), 
            sep= " ") %>% 
  separate (col = hour, into = c("hour", "mins"), 
            sep= ":") %>%
  mutate(hour=replace(hour, hour==24, 00), hour=replace(hour, hour==0, 00)) %>% 
  rename(duration_s =`duration (seconds)`, duration_hm =`duration (hours/min)`) %>% 
  filter(country=="us") %>%
  drop_na
```


To explore the dataset, I focused on the variables year, month, day, hour, state, shape and duration_s. I created individual plots for the variables to visualize their distributions. The bar charts illustrating the distributions of the categorical variables show that UFO sightings are most common in Arizona (az) state, people only see a light most of the time, and the number of UFO report was steadily growing from 1910 to 2013 (the decrease in 2014 could have been caused by the dataset not showing the whole year's reports). 
Reports of sightings seem to be more frequent in the summer and autumn months, and show a quite equal distribution throughout the days of the months, except for the 1st and 15th days, which have twice the number of reports. This is probably caused by people trying to give a more exact date to vague timeframes, like "the beginning of July" (that, or something ambiguously paranormal). The highest number of sightings happen in the evening or at night.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
p1<-ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x=state, fill=state))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0))

p2<-ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x=shape, fill=shape))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0))

p3<-ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x=year, fill=year))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=5,angle = 90, hjust = 0))

p4<-ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x=month, fill=month))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(1:12))

p5<-ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x=day, fill=day))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(1:31))

p6<-ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x=hour, fill=hour))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)
  
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, ncol=2,nrow=3)
```


The only continuous variable in the dataset was duration_s (duration in seconds). Since it ranged from a couple of seconds to several years (with a mean of ~5546 s, a median of 180 s, a minimum of 1 s and maximum of 66276000 s), instead of presenting it on a histogram I decided to create duration groups (duration_group) to be able to visualize the data. The bar chart of the grouped duration data shows that it is very rare for a UFO sighting to last more 5 hours, and most of them continue for less than 30 minutes, usually only a couple of seconds or minutes.


<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
# basic descriptives of the duration_s variable
data_tidy %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(duration_s), sd=sd(duration_s),variance=var(duration_s), median=median(duration_s), 
            iqr=IQR(duration_s), min=min(duration_s), max=max(duration_s))

data2<-
  data_tidy %>% 
  mutate(duration_group = case_when(
    duration_s < 60 ~ "seconds",
    duration_s >= 60 & duration_s < 300 ~"1-5 min",
    duration_s >= 300 & duration_s < 600 ~"5-10 min",
    duration_s >= 600 & duration_s< 1800 ~"10-30 min",
    duration_s >= 1800 & duration_s < 3600 ~"0.5-1 h",
    duration_s >= 3600 & duration_s < 18000 ~"1-5 h",
    duration_s >= 1800 & duration_s < 86400 ~"5-24 h",
    duration_s >= 86400 & duration_s < 604800 ~"1-7 days",
    duration_s >= 604800 & duration_s < 2592000 ~"1-5 weeks",
    duration_s >= 2592000 & duration_s < 15552000 ~"1-6 months",
    duration_s >= 15552000 & duration_s < 31536000 ~"0.5-1 year",
    duration_s > 31536000 ~ ">1 year")
  ) 

ggplot(data2, aes(x=duration_group, fill=duration_group))+
  geom_bar()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("seconds","1-5 min","5-10 min","10-30 min",
                            "0.5-1 h","1-5 h","5-24 h","1-7 days","1-5 weeks",
                            "1-6 months","0.5-1 year",">1 year"))
```
</center>

For the following part of analysis I used the data that have sighting duration of less than 30 minutes (1800 seconds). I illustrated the distribution of that portion of the duration data with a histogram, which shows a non-normal distribution, and certain values are present more frequently (most of them probably rounded to 5-10-15 minutes).

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
data3<-
  data2 %>% 
  filter(duration_s<1800)

# histogram
ggplot(data3, aes(x=duration_s))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=30, fill="#005566")


```
</center>

In the next section I investigated the possible relationship between the duration of the sightings and two other factors, the reported shape of the UFO and the lighting conditions og the sighting.

### Hypotheses and modeling  


* #### UFO shape and sighting duration

People reported a large number of UFOs with a number of very different shapes. Regardles of the true origins of these objects, they probably differ in many of their properties, one might be that how loght are they are staying in one place or in a visible distance from the ground.

To investigate whether different shapes of UFOs are seen for different durations, I compared the 4 most commonly reported shapes (circle, fireball, light and triangle - all described in more than 5000 accounts) using their sighting durations. My hypothesis was that since two of these commonly seen shapes are only lights, and nothing about the shape of the object is revealed, the sightings would be shorter as well, because short sightings would end in less detailed reports. 

Due to the dependent variable (duration_s) not being normally distributed, and the assumption of homogenity of variance of the planned analysis being violated (K2(3) = 247.07, p<0.001), I used a non-parametric Kruskal_Wallis test to test my hypothesis. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference between the four shapes (circle: Med=120, IQR=315; fireball: Med=120, IQR=290;light: Med=120, IQR=330; triangle: Med=120, IQR=270; H(3)= 267.09, p<.001). The post-hoc analysis consisting of separate Mann-Whitney U tests showed significantly lower duration for fireball shaped UFOs compared to all other shapes (p values were all < 0.001).

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
data_shape<-
  data3 %>% 
  filter(shape=="circle" | shape=="fireball" | shape=="light" | shape=="triangle") %>% 
  mutate(shape=as.factor(shape))

# variance homogenity
bartlett.test(duration_s ~ shape, data = data_shape)

# Descriptives
data_shape %>% 
  group_by(shape) %>% 
  summarize(median(duration_s), IQR(duration_s), min(duration_s), max(duration_s))

# Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(duration_s ~ shape, data = data_shape)
# post-hoc comparisons with pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests
pairwise.wilcox.test(data_shape$duration_s, data_shape$shape, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

# boxplot
ggplot(data_shape, aes(shape, duration_s, fill=shape)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)
```
</center>



* #### Lighting conditions and duration of sighting

We learned through the explorative analysis, that there are more sightings during the evening/night, and we could also assume that this difference is due to the different lighting conditions. According to my hypothesis, during the nighttime most reported UFOs used some kind of light, and because of that people could discern them for a longer time. To devide the time periods with dark and bright light conditions more clearly, I categorized the time from 7 am to 4 pm as light, and the time from 21 pm to 5 am as dark (the other hours of the day were not included in the analysis). Due to the non-normal distribution of the duration_s data, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for the analysis. The test showed a significant difference between the durations of the sighings happening in dark (Med=120, IQR=280) or light (Med=120, IQR=270) lighting (U=128330000, p<0.01). Although it doesn't discernable on the boxplot and it might be due to the size of the data. The boxplot shows a slight trend towards the sightings in the dark lighting condition being longer.

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}

data_light<-
  data3 %>% 
  mutate(hour=as.numeric(hour), light_dark = case_when(hour >= 7 & hour <= 16 ~ "light", 
                                hour >= 21 | hour <= 5 ~ "dark", 
                                hour>5 & hour<7 ~ "ambiguous", 
                                hour>16 & hour<21 ~ "ambiguous"), 
         light_dark=as.factor(light_dark)) %>% 
  filter(light_dark!="ambiguous")

# Descriptives
data_light %>% 
  group_by(light_dark) %>% 
  summarize(median(duration_s), IQR(duration_s), min(duration_s), max(duration_s))
# Mann-Whitney U test
wilcox.test(duration_s ~ light_dark, data=data_light) 

# boxplot
ggplot(data_light, aes(light_dark, duration_s, fill=light_dark)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)
```
</center>


### Conclusions

The statistical analysis of the relationship between the duration of the UFO sightings and the shape of the object showed that one of the most commonly reported shape, "fireball" is observed for significantly shorter durations, than other objects. Since people could describe a moving light-source as a fireball, this result could be explained by this shape being reported for most fast-moving objects.
The duration of the sighting was also different for the dark and sunlit periods of that day, but the direction of this difference is not that easily discernable. The sightings being slightly longer in the darker hours of the day could be explained by the emitted light of the objects being more salient.

These observations are most probably the consequences of human factors and not the preferences of alien life for luring in the dark and making quick detours on fireball-shaped spaceships. But regardless, the truth might be still out there.
